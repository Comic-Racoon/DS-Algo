Big - Oh Notation. (O)
---
Word Defiantion:
-   eg, suppose comlexit of our function is O(n^3)
    The complexity O(n^3) is upper bound it mens 
    your function may be less that the respectiive complexity
    but it wouldn't exceed that 

Maths :

-   lim  f(x)
    n->∞ ----   < ∞
         g(x)

Big - Omega Notation. (Ω)
---
Word Defiantion
-   It's the lower bound 
    your function may be more that the respectiive complexity
    but it wouldn't be less that that

Maths : 

-   lim  f(x)
    n->∞ ----   > 0
         g(x)

What if an algo has lower and upper bound of n^2 how can we show that

Both above combining lower and upper bound
