What is time complexity ?
- Time complexity is a term used in computer science describe the amount of
  time an algo. takes to run as a function of these size of it's input.
- In other words, time complexity is a measure how efficiently an algo
  Works

Note:
-   Time Comp. is a function that gives us the relation ship about how time will grow as
    the input grows

Procedure for Analysing Complexity

What do we consider, when thinking about complexity?
-   Always look for worst complexity
-   Always look at complexity fpr large data 
-   ~ Even though value of actual time is diff they all growing linearly
    ~ We don't care about actual time. 
    ~ Hence we dont need constant.
